                        <p>The objective of the lab is to control the car using open loop control, rather than the 
                            manual controller. Two dual motor drivers will be connected to the car's motors and the 
                            Artemis board. The dual motor drivers will be used to control the movement of the car.

                    <h3 class="mb-0">Sketch Of Wiring Diagram</h3> <!----------------------------------------------->
                        <p>Below is a wiring diagram for the two dual motor drivers connected to the Artemis board, 
                            DC Motors, and 850mAh battery. The two VIN pins and the two GND pins on both dual motor 
                            drivers are connected together and then connected to the 850mAh battery. The GND pin of 
                            one of the dual motor drivers is connected to the GND of the Artemis board. There is a 
                            bridge between the BOUT1 and AOUT1 pins of the dual motor driver that is then connected 
                            to the DC motor. There is also a bridge between the BOUT2 and AOUT2 pins of the dual motor 
                            driver that is then connected to the DC motor. There is a bridge between the BIN1 and AIN1 
                            pins on the dual motor driver and there is also a bridge between the BIN2 and AIN2 pins. 
                            On the dual motor driver that connects the drivers to the ground of the Artemis board (top 
                            dual motar driver in sketch below), the bridge between BIN1 and AIN1 is connected to pin 11, 
                            and the bridge between BIN2 and AIN2 is connected to pin 12. On the other dual motor driver 
                            (bottom dual motor driver in sketch below) the bridge between BIN1 and AIN1 is connected 
                            to pin 7, and the bridge between BIN2 and AIN2 is connected to pin 9. The pins used in this 
                            lab were chosen from the remaining pins on the Artemis board (after the previous lab). The 
                            parallel-couple of the two inputs and two outputs on each dual motor driver allows for 
                            twice the average current to be delivered without overheating.

                    <h3 class="mb-0">Battery Discussion</h3> <!----------------------------------------------------->
                        <p>The Artemis board and the motor drivers/motors are powered from separate batteries. The 
                            Artemis board is powered using a 650mAh battery and the motors are powered using a 850mAh 
                            battery. Having the Artemis board and motors powered by different power sources avoids 
                            any potential transient effects and allows each component to function independently. Any
                            potential current changes in the motors will not affect the Artemis board. In addition, 
                            the motors require a higher current battery, which is the reason the 850mAh battery is 
                            used to power the motors.

                            <p>The below image is a picture of the power supply and oscilloscope connections. The 
                                positive power supply wire (red, towards the top of the picture) is connected to the 
                                positive wire of the battery. The ground wire of the power supply (black) and 
                                oscilloscope (black) is connected to the same ground wire of the battery (near the 
                                middle of the picture). The input for the oscilloscope (near the bottom of the 
                                picture) is connected to the wire that will be attached to one of the motors. Each of 
                                the four wires that will be attached to the motors was tested to determine if the 
                                circuit was assembled correctly and a PWM signal was shown on the oscilloscope.

                            <p>The voltage of the 850mAh battery is 3.7V. In place of using the battery, a power supply 
                                was used. The output of the power supply was set to 3.7V to represent the battery 
                                power that will be used later on during the lab. Each pin was tested independently of 
                                each other. In the Arduino IDE code, one pin was set to have an output of 200, while 
                                the other pins all had an output of 0. This was repeated for all four pins. The positive 
                                output voltage to the motor was displayed on the oscilloscope and indicated a constant 
                                voltage output at each time. The PWM values show that power can be regulated on the motor 
                                driver output.

                            <p>Channel 3 of the power supply was used. 3.7V was used to test the motor driver circuit.</p>

                            <p>The below Arduino code shows how each of the wires to the motors were tested. Pins 7, 
                                9, 11, and 12 were defined and analogWrite() was used to assign each pin number the 
                                tested output value. In the below example pin 11 is set to have an output of 200, and
                                all of the other pins have an output of 0.

                        <h4 class="mb-0">Video Of Wheels Spinning (Each Side Of Robot)</h4> <!---------------------->
                            <p>The wheels on each side of the robot were tested individually at two different output 
                                values. The power supply used at the beginning of the lab (3.7V) was used to power 
                                the motors. Pins 7, 9, 11, and 12 were tested at output values of  50 and 200. While 
                                testing each side of the robot I observed the direction and speed that each wheel 
                                turned. The wheels rotated faster for the higher output at 200 compared to the output 
                                at 50. For the higher output value of 200, the wheels reached the final set speed faster 
                                compared to the lower set speed. When rotating at 50 the wheels took longer to start rotating.
                                From the perspective of the videos pin 7 rotates counter clockwise and pin 9 
                                rotates clockwise. Pin 7 and pin 9 move the wheels on the same side of the robot in 
                                different directions. In addition, from the perspective of the videos pin 11 moves 
                                clockwise and pin 12 moves counter clockwise. Pin 11 and pin 12 move the wheels on 
                                the same side of the robot in different directions. To consolidate the report, all 
                                of the videos taken can be found in this folder: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C0Mv_Gn857_GPnvRFywwlARlJ5vl_ICM?usp=sharing">Folder Link</a>

                            <p>The Arduino code to test the wheels is found below. One pin was set to have an output

                                video below shows my first test for having the robot drive on the ground. In the video, 
                                the robot initially moves towards the left when the pins used for the motors have the 
                                same output value. This trend was noticed in future steps of the lab when determining 
                                how to calibrate each of the motors.

                            <p>During this step of the lab, I used Bluetooth to send a command from Jupyter Notebook 
                                to run different output values more easily compared to uploading Arduino IDE code every
                                time I wanted to change the output value of a pin. The below images show the Jupyter
                                Notebook Command and the Arduino IDE case that uses analogWrite() to move the robot.

                            <p>The lower limit PWM value is the lowest output value that a pin can be set to that will 
                                still result in continuous motion of the robot. The wheels on one side of the robot 
                                were tested, while the wheels on the other side remained stationary. The lower limit 
                                PWM for pin 11 (right side) was found to be 59. The lower limit PWM for pin 7 (left
                                side) was found to be 50. 
                            </p>                       
                            <p>Note: During lab office hours I asked a TA (Larry Lu) about how the surface conditions 
                                affect the PWM values. Specifically I asked if testing the robot on the floors in my 
                                apartment (laminate wood flooring) would change the lower limit PWM value compared to 
                                the tile floors in the lab and hallways. I tested the robot's lower limit PWM value at 
                                my apartment and received the same PWM values. The PWM values may start to differ if 
                                the robot is travelling over a surface with a lot of friction such as a carpet or 
                                outside in the grass. This information is helpful to know as I can better understand 
                                the operating conditions of the robot.

                            <p>I also found the PWM value for both wheels when they are being used together, starting 
                                when the robot is stationary. The output value was found to be 35 for both wheel sides.

                        <h4 class="mb-0">Calibration Demonstration</h4> <!------------------------------------------>
                            <p>The wheels of the robot do not spin at the same rate and a calibration factor needed 
                                to be implemented. The below video shows the robot moving in a straight line, starting
                                at 7 feet and then continuing past the end of the tape measure. For the demonstration,
                                pin 11 was set to an output of 60 and pin 7 was set to an output of 70. In addition to 
                                the below video, the robot was run multiple times at varying input values. My first 
                                tested value was pin 11 at an output of 60, which is close to the found PWM value from 
                                the previous step. When pin 7 was set to an output of 51, the robot continuously moved 
                                towards the left. Through trial and error I found that an output of 70 for pin 7 kept 
                                the robot moving in a straight line. I used these found values for reference during 
                                future tests: 70/60=1.166666666666667. 
                            </p>
                            <p>I increased the output of pin 11 by 20 for each 
                                test and multiplied the value for pin 7 by 1.166666666666667. This incrementation worked 
                                for all tested pin 11 and pin 7 values until I reached an output value of 220 for pin 11. 
                                The calculated output value for pin 7 should be 257, rounded down to 255 due to 255 being
                                the maximum output value. For this test the robot continuously moved towards the right 
                                and the value for pin 7 needed to be lowered to 250 to keep the robot moving straight. 
                                Due to this discovery, I decided to also test an output value of 210 for pin 11, the 
                                calculated output value for pin 7 should be 245. In order to keep the robot moving 
                                straight, and not to the right I needed to reduce the output of pin 7 to 240. The trend 
                                shows that after an output of 200 for pin 11 the calibration factor to find the 
                                corresponding output value for pin 7 starts to differ. 
                            </p>
                            <p>In addition, as a final test I 
                                wanted to determine how low I could set the output values while still having the robot 
                                move in a straight line for at least 6 feet. I set the output value of pin 11 to 40 and 
                                calculated the output value of pin 7 to be 47. For these output values, the robot moved 
                                in a straight line for more than 6 feet. When I set the output value for pin 11 to be 
                                lower than 40 the wheels began to stall and hesitate before rotating compared to the other 
                                side of the robot. I also included a video at the end of the section showing the wheels 
                                spinning.
                            </p>
                            <p>To produce the robots motion the same Arduino IDE case and Jupyter Notebook command were 
                                used. The length of the delay was changed depending on how fast the robot moved (to prevent 
                                the robot from running into a wall). All of the recorded videos are in <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MPB9ob9C-Wnmy3WKEV63vXBIjMhBrcxV?usp=drive_link">this folder.</a>

                            <p>Below is a graph showing all of the tested values as data points. In addition, I plotted the 
                                trendline for all data points, as well as the trendline for all of the data points except 
                                for the last two that began to differ from the previous measurements. The slope and 
                                y-intercept were also found for each trendline. The calculated slope is the calibration 
                                factor. The slope excluding the last two data points, 1.165 is close to the 1.166666666666667
                                value.

                            <p>I also tested the calibration factor when the robot is going in "reverse" (with the robot 
                                moving in the direction away from the ToF sensor on one end). I initially tested the 
                                previously found output values with the corresponding pins on each wheel side, with pin 12 
                                having an output of 60 and pin 9 having an output of 70. I found that by doing this the 
                                robot moved towards the left. I decided to switch the output values; pin 12 has an output 
                                of 70 and pin 9 has an output of 60). The robot moves straight using these output values. 
                                I find this interesting as it confirm my previous thoughts about one side of the wheels 
                                being slightly misaligned.

                        <h4 class="mb-0">analogWrite Frequency Discussion</h4> <!----------------------------------->
                            <p>Below is the image of the oscilloscope when connected to the circuit. The wheel motors 
                                are powered using the battery. During lab office hours I asked a TA why the oscilloscope 
                                outputs were ore noisy compared to the oscilloscope outputs from earlier in the lab and 
                                it is most likely because the circuit is now connected to the motors that result in more 
                                noise compared to when the circuit was not connected to the motors on the robot.
                            </p>
                            <img width="550" height="auto" src="Lab4/analogWrite5000.png"></img>
                            <p>From the image its can be seen that one horizontal block along the x-axis is 2.50ms and 
                                one vertical block along the y-axis is 1.0V. The period of the PWM signal is about 2.6 
                                horizontal blocks, which is equivalent to 6.50ms (0.0065s). The frequency analogWrite() 
                                generates is about 1/0.0065s ~= 154Hz. In lab 3 the sampling period of the ToF sensors
                                was found to be 0.04s and the sampling frequency was 25Hz. The frequency analogWrite() 
                                generates is fast enough for the motors on the robot when running tests as well as when 
                                using data from the ToF sensors. Manually configuring the timers to generate a faster PWM
                                signal will allow for more control over the movements of the robot and a more steady PWM 
                                signal.
                            </p>

                            <p>The lowest PWM value for each side of the robot was found by running the robot with an 
                                initial output of 60 for pin 11 and 70 for pin 7 to correspond with the found 
                                calibration values. The robot ran with these outputs for 3 seconds and then all pin 
                                outputs were set to zero expect either pin 11 or pin 7. Either pin 11 or pin 7 remained 
                                turned on for another 3 seconds, but decreased to a lower output value. I ran the robot 
                                multiple times to determine at what output value the robot no longer moved. It was 
                                determined that for pin 11 the lowest PWM output is 35 and for pin 7 the lowest PWM 
                                output is 33. The videos for each pin can be found below.
                            </p>

                            <iframe width="550" height="400" src="https://youtube.com/embed/y8LbCTM5KOg"></iframe>
                            <p>In addition, the lowest combined wheel PWM value was found when both wheels were being 
                                used at the same time. The output value for both wheels (pin 11 and pin 7) is 25 when 
                                the robot is already moving. The robot was initially run with an initial output of 60 
                                for pin 11 and 70 for pin 7 for 1.5 seconds and then both wheels decreased to an output 
                                of 25 for 5 seconds. Below are two videos. One video shows the final output at 25 (the 
                                robot moves until the total set time of 5 seconds is over). The other video shows the 
                                robot stop before the 5 seconds is over and the motors stall when set to an output of 
                                24, confirming the lower limit PWM value of 25 to keep the robot moving.

                    <h3 class="mb-0">Task 1: Note The I2C Sensor Address</h3> <!------------------------------------>
                        <p>From the datasheet it was found that the I2C sensor address for the ToF sensor is 0x52. 
                            The two ToF sensors have the same address and one of the addresses will need to be changed 
                            in order to receive data from both sensors at the same time. 
                        </p>
                    <h3 class="mb-0">Task 2: Approach To Using Two ToF Sensors</h3> <!------------------------------>
                        <p>To use two ToF sensors, the XSHUT pin will be used to connect one of the ToF sensors to pin 
                            8 on the Artemis board. The XSHUT pin will be set to LOW and then the I2C sensor address 
                            will be changed for the other ToF sensor that is on. After the I2C address has been changed 
                            the XSHUT pin will be set to HIGH, turning the other TOF sensor back on. This will allow for 
                            both ToF sensors to be used in parallel. 
                        </p>
                    <h3 class="mb-0">Task 3: Placement Of Sensors On Robot</h3> <!---------------------------------->
                        <p>The placement of the two ToF sensors on the robot will impact the field of vision. Two 
                            long QWIIC connectors will be used to attach the ToF sensors. Longer connectors will allow 
                            me to position the ToF sensors in more potential ways compared to shorter wires. The 
                            potential arrangements of the sensors include (1) a sensor on the front and left side, 
                            (2) a sensor on the front and right side, (3) two sensors positioned on either side of 
                            the front of the robot, and (4) a sensor on the front and the back. Depending on the task 
                            at hand any of these sensor positions may be effective. 
                            If there is no sensor on the back of the robot there might be an issue if the robot needs 
                            to back up or move in reverse. If there is no sensor on the side then the robot might miss 
                            an obstacle that is located in a blind spot.

                            <p>One ToF sensor was connected during the scan. The sensor had an I2C address of 0x29. 
                                In the datasheet for the ToF sensor, the listed I2C address is 0x52. The 
                                Example05_Wire_I2C.ino code returned an address of 0x29. This is a result of the

                                an address of 0x29 (binary: 0b00101001). The rightmost bit is ignored because the bit

                                that the short mode can only reach up to 1.3m and is the most resistant to ambient 
                                light. The long mode can reach up to 4m but is very sensitive to ambient light, which 
                                decreases the distance to 0.73m. The timing budget range for the short mode is 20ms - 
                                1000ms. The timing range for the long mode is 33ms - 1000ms. Short mode has greater 
                                accuracy and less sensor noise compared to the long mode. While it would be beneficial 
                                for a robot that needs to sense objects farther away to use the long mode, for this lab 
                                I am prioritizing accuracy and choose to test the short mode.

                            <p>Sensor Range:</p>
                            <p>In the datasheet it is stated that the short mode for the ToF sensor has a range up to 1.3m.
                                To test the range of the sensor I took an initial measurement at 100mm and continued to take 
                                measurements up to 1900mm. The graph below shows the actual distance of the ToF sensor from 
                                the wall vs the ToF sensor distance.
                                The plotted measured distance value is the mean value of the ten collected data 
                                points. From the graph below it can be seen that after 1.3m the measured values start to 
                                differ more from the actual values compared to measured values less than 1.3m.

                            <p>The difference in the measured and actual distances was plotted against the actual distances the 
                                ToF sensor was from the wall. When the ToF sensor is less than 1.3m from the wall, the difference 
                                is between 18mm and 40mm. After 1.3m the difference in the measured vs actual distance increases.

                                for measurements under 1.3m. After 1.3m the standard deviation starts to vary and the standard 
                                deviation at 1900mm is 8.75mm.

                            <h4 class="mb-0">Active and Passive Infrared Sensors</h4>
                            <p>The two main types of infrared sensors are active and passive infrared sensors. Passive 
                                infrared sensors sense nearby emitted infrared light, using a difference in signals 
                                between two pyroelectric sensors. These sensors are often used for security 
                                purposes to detect if there is a heat energy change in the environment, but cannot 
                                determine the distance to an object.
                                Active infrared sensors use an emitter and receiver to determine the distance
                                to an object.  
                                If there is an obstruction, the active infrared sensor knows that there is an object 
                                in between the emitter and receiver. Active infrared sensors are used in industry 
                                conveyor belts, as well as in garage door safety mechanisms.

                            <p>Four colors and three textures were tested at a distance of 500mm. Colors include pink, 
                                blue, yellow, and red. Textures include a hand towel, rug, and folder. The control 
                                surface was the dark grey wall that I used throughout the lab for distance readings.
                                The change in color or texture did not affect the ToF sensor's distance output that 
                                remained around 478mm.

                        <p>The example code found under 
                            SparkFun 9DOF IMU Breakout - ICM 20948 - Arduino Library->Arduino->Example1_Basics 
                            was run to test if the IMU was working correctly. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Upon opening the Example1_Basics code, the AD0_VAL default was set to one. When the ADR 
                            jumper is closed the value should be set to zero. AD0_VAL corresponds to the last bit 
                            of the I2C address. My ADR jumer on the IMU was closed. For this reason, I needed to 
                            change the AD0_VAL to zero to return the accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and 
                            temperature data.
                        </p>
                        <p>While viewing the output data 
                            in the serial monitor, I moved the IMU to change the accelerometer and gyroscope data. I 
                            looked at the notated axis that was printed on the IMU and moved the IMU along the X, 
                            Y, and Z axis. I noticed that the respective X, Y, and Z serial monitor outputs for the 
                            accelerometer increased 
                            when I moved the IMU along the respective positive axis. The gyroscope data for pitch, roll, 
                            and yaw also changed when I rotated the IMU around the X, Y, and Z axis.

                            Note: The data for the graphs was collected by holding the IMU against the table using my hand. 
                            This may have resulted in some error due to the surface level or any small hand movements. In the
                            future the IMU should be calibrated when it is secured to the robot to achieve the most accurate

                        <p>The noise in the accelerometer was examined using a Fast Fourier Transform. Data for the FFT was 
                            collected as I moved the IMU. The sinusoid and the FFT graphs can be found below. There is a large 
                            spike closer to 0Hz and less noise as the frequency increases. 
                            Note: I modified the code from Stephan Wagner's Ed Discussion post to plot the FFT graphs.

                        <p>From observing the above graphs, I choose a cutoff frequency of 25Hz to use for a low pass filter. 
                            Using the determined cutoff frequency, I calculated the alpha used in the low pass filter. The 
                            equations from lecture are below:

                        <p>The low pass filter was implemented in Arduino. The code to find pitch and roll for the accelerometer

                            low pass filter (blue). Choosing a lower cut off frequency reduces more noise.

                            due to a pre-existing internal low pass filter. The information for this can be found on page 10 of

                            below graphs the IMU was moved slightly to achieve different outputs.

                        <p>The drift for the gyroscope can be better seen in the below graphs. The gyroscope was held in the same 
                            position as the data was collected. As time increases the measurements drift away from the starting value.

                        <p>Decreasing the sampling frequency resulted in a slower update to the angle measurements and more variation 
                            in the outputs between each successive measurement. The sample rate should be high to achieve the greatest 
                            level of accuracy when recording data.

                        <p>The complimentary filter shows resistance to small vibrations as the IMU is moved during data collection. The 
                            complimentary filter reduces noise compared to the accelerometer output. Alpha is a set constant that represents 
                            how well the accelerometer output measures the correct pitch and roll data. I examined how different alpha values 
                            affected the graphs. In the below graphs alpha = 0.5

                        <p>All of the accelerometer and gyroscope data print statements and any delays in the ble_arduino.ino file were removed 
                            in order to speed up the execution of the main loop. A case called "ACC_GYR" was created that checked if the data was 
                            ready in the main loop, and if there was data available stored it in arrays. After speeding up the loop I found that 
                            new values were sampled every 0.04s, which is a sampling frequency of 1/0.04s = 25Hz.

                        <p>The data is stored in arrays on the Artemis board before being sent to Jupyter Notebook. There are 7 arrays including 
                            time (1); accelerometer: x (2), y (3), z (4); gyroscope: x (5), y (6), z (7). I choose to use separate arrays because
                            in the future I can decide what data I want to send to Jupyter Notebook. The data type used to store the data is a float.
                            I choose to use a float as it is less bytes then a double, allowing for more data to be stored on the memory of the 
                            Artemis. A float is 4 bytes, resulting in one packet of data information for the 7 arrays to be 28 bytes. The Artemis has 
                            384kB of RAM. Sampling at 0.04s (25Hz) will result in data being collected for 548 seconds.

                        <p>The robot is moved using the controller. The robot can move very quickly, but it is hard to 
                            control the speed. If the robot changes directions too quickly there is a chance that it 
                            might flip over. It is also hard to slow down the robot to a stop. When slowing down the 
                            robot, the reverse needs to be applied. This is easy to over compensate and the robot might 
                            end up traveling in reverse rather than coming to a stop.

                            <h3 class="mb-0">5000 Level Task 1: LED and Musical A4</h3>
                            <p>The Artemis board was programmed to turn on the LED when the musical note A4 is played 
                                on a speaker (code below). I started with the Example01_MicrophoneOutput sketch, 
                                and I added if statements (lines 113-122 below). The note A4 is 440Hz 
                                <a href="https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/eecs20/week8/scale.html#:~:text=The%20frequencies%20440Hz%20and%20880Hz,12%20notes%20in%20every%20octave.">(UC Berkeley Reference)</a>. 
                                The first if statement determines if the frequency is between 430Hz and 450Hz to account 
                                for any slight error in sound quality. If the frequency is within range an “A4” statement 
                                will be displayed in the Serial Monitor and the LED on the Artemis board will turn on. 
                                The second if statement determines if the frequency is lower than 430Hz or greater than 
                                450Hz. If the frequency is lower than 430Hz or greater than 450Hz a “Not A4” statement 
                                will be displayed in the Serial Monitor and the LED on the Artemis board will turn off.

                            <p>I added to the LED and Musical A4 task by creating a musical tuner. There are eleven total

<!-- Lab 1 Part 1 Discussion --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
                    <h2 class="mb-2.5">Discussion: Part 1</h2>
                    <p>I tested the connection between the Artemis board and the computer. Tasks performed included 
                        turning on and off an Artemis board LED, printing serial monitor outputs, viewing temperature 
                        data in the serial monitor, testing the microphone, and creating a musical tuner. 
                    </p>
<!-- Lab 1 Part 2 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
                    <h2 class="mb-5">Part 2</h2>
                    <p>Tested the Bluetooth communication between the computer and the Artemis board. Python in a 
                        Jupyter Notebook was used for the computer and Arduino IDE was used for the Artemis board.
                    </p>
<!-- Lab 1 Part 2 Prelab: Setup ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
                    <h2 class="mb-2.5">Prelab: Setup</h2>
                    <p>During the setup for the lab I already had installed Python 3. I needed to install pip by 
                        running the line "python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv" in the Command Line Interface 
                        (CLI). I created a folder called “MAE 5190 Lab” where I put all of the Jupyter Notebook files. 
                        I then created a virtual environment by typing "python3 -m venv FastRobots_ble" in the CLI. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The virtual environment was activated by typing "source FastRobots_ble/bin/activate" and then 
                        deactivated by typing "deactivate". 
                    </p>
                    <p>The python packages were installed by entering "pip install numpy pyyaml colorama nest_asyncio 
                        bleak jupyterlab" into the CLI.
                    </p>
                    <p>CLI entered commands:
                    </p>

                    <p>I also needed to install matplotlib to use for the 5000 level tasks. I asked a TA for help with 
                        the installation. Below is a picture of the command entered into the CLI.
                    </p>
                    <img width="auto" height="30" src="assets/img/matplotlib.png"></img>
                    <p>To import modules into the Jupyter Notebook the following lines of code were run.

                    <p>After uploading the provided ble_ardunio.ino file to the Artemis board the MAC address was 
                        printed in the serial monitor. The MAC address is c0:83:34:6a:b2:3c The image below shows 
                        the Arduino serial monitor with the printed MAC address.

<!-- Lab 1 Part 2 Prelab: Codebase --------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
                    <h2 class="mb-2.5">Prelab: Codebase</h2>
                    <p>I installed the provided codebase into the project directory and copied the provided 
                        “ble_python” directory into the project directory. Then the Jupyter Notebook was opened by 
                        entering “jupyter lab” into the CLI (shown below).
                    </p>
                    <img width="auto" height="20" src="assets/img/jupyterlab.png"></img>
                    <p>To set up Bluetooth communication, the MAC address needed to be changed in the Jupyter 
                        Notebook connection.yaml file to match the advertised MAC address from the Artemis board. 
                        Then unique UUID addresses needed to be used in the connection.yaml file and Arduino IDE 
                        because some devices in the lab may have the same MAC address. Using UUIDs ensures that 
                        the computer is receiving data from the correct Artemis board. The UUIDs were generated in 
                        the Jupyter Notebook demo.ipynb file and then entered into the connection.yaml and 
                        ble_arduino.ino files. Below is a picture of the lines of code used in the demo.ipynb file 
                        to generate the UUIDs.

                    <p>Several command types needed to be defined to complete the tasks outlined in the next section. 
                        Added commands include ECHO, GET_TIME_MILLIS, GET_TIME_MILLIS_LOOP, SEND_TIME_DATA,

                            <p>A globally defined array to store time stamps was implemented. Inside of the for loop 
                                each time stamp is put inside of the “timearray”. The data is then sent as an array 
                                to the computer using Jupyter Notebook. 
                            </p>
                            <p>To find the data transfer rate the length of the data was computed by assembling the 
                                individual outputs into an array in the Jupyter Notebook. The number of strings in 
                                each element of the array is 9, and the number of elements in the array is 2748. 
                                The time difference of the final (49.730s) and starting time (49.685s) was found to 
                                be 0.045 seconds. The data transfer rate is

                            <p>The method used in Task 4 involved sending the current time from the Artemis board to 
                                the computer. Each time was sent as an individual piece of data. The method used in 
                                Task 5 involved creating an array of times that was stored on the memory of the 
                                Artemis board and then sent to the computer to display the collected data. 
                            </p>
                            <p>The data transfer rate of the array method used in Task 5 (549600 bytes/second) is 
                                faster than the data transfer rate when sending individual pieces of data in Task 4 
                                (1348.018 bytes/second).
                            </p>
                            <p>An advantage of sending data individually as in Task 4 is that less memory on the 
                                Artemis board is being used, but the disadvantage is a slower data transfer rate. 
                                An advantage of sending data as an array as in Task 5 is that there is a faster data 
                                transfer rate, but a disadvantage is that more memory is being used on the Artemis 
                                to store the array.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Artemis board has a maximum storage of 384 kB of RAM. If 16 bit values at 150 Hz 
                                were sampled every 5 seconds, 256 values would be stored before running out of memory 
                                on the Artemis board. The calculations can be found below.

                            <p>I sent a message from the computer and received a reply from the Artemis board. The data 
                                rate for 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, and 120 bytes was tested. The 
                                data rate for 5 bytes is 132.722 bytes/s and the data rate for 120 bytes is 2003.210 
                                bytes/s. The plotted graph shows that as the number of bytes sent to the Artemis board

                                the data from each window into Matlab variables titled time1 and temp1 for the 
                                Jupyter Notebook data, and time2 and temp2 for the Artemis data. I wrote a script to 
                                compare the corresponding time and temperature data and record how many data points 
                                are the same and how many are different. If there is a data point in the Jupyter 
                                Notebook that does not correspond to the Artemis board, or vice versa, an error 
                                message is displayed. The output variables in the workspace show that all data points 
                                are the same. The reliability is 100%.
