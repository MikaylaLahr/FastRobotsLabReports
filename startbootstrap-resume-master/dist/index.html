                    <h3 class="mb-0">Task 1: Note The I2C Sensor Address</h3> <!------------------------------------>
                        <p>From the datasheet it was found that the I2C sensor address for the ToF sensor is 0x52. 
                            The two ToF sensors have the same address and one of the addresses will need to be changed 
                            in order to receive data from both sensors at the same time. 
                        </p>
                    <h3 class="mb-0">Task 2: Approach To Using Two ToF Sensors</h3> <!------------------------------>
                        <p>To use two ToF sensors, the XSHUT pin will be used to connect one of the ToF sensors to pin 
                            8 on the Artemis board. The XSHUT pin will be set to LOW and then the I2C sensor address 
                            will be changed for the other ToF sensor that is on. After the I2C address has been changed 
                            the XSHUT pin will be set to HIGH, turning the other TOF sensor back on. This will allow for 
                            both ToF sensors to be used in parallel. 
                        </p>
                    <h3 class="mb-0">Task 3: Placement Of Sensors On Robot</h3> <!---------------------------------->
                        <p>The placement of the two ToF sensors on the robot will impact the field of vision. Two 
                            long QWIIC connectors will be used to attach the ToF sensors. Longer connectors will allow 
                            me to position the ToF sensors in more potential ways compared to shorter wires. The 
                            potential arrangements of the sensors include (1) a sensor on the front and left side, 
                            (2) a sensor on the front and right side, (3) two sensors positioned on either side of 
                            the front of the robot, and (4) a sensor on the front and the back. Depending on the task 
                            at hand any of these sensor positions may be effective. 
                            If there is no sensor on the back of the robot there might be an issue if the robot needs 
                            to back up or move in reverse. If there is no sensor on the side then the robot might miss 
                            an obstacle that is located in a blind spot.

                            <p>One ToF sensor was connected during the scan. The sensor had an I2C address of 0x29. 
                                In the datasheet for the ToF sensor, the listed I2C address is 0x52. The 
                                Example05_Wire_I2C.ino code returned an address of 0x29. This is a result of the 
                                binary for address 0x52 (binary: 0b01010010) being shifted to the right, resulting in 
                                an address of 0x29 (binary: 0b00101001). The rightmost bit is ignored because the bit 
                                identifies if data is read/write.

                            <h4 class="mb-0">Sensor Mode Discussion</h4> <!----------------------------------------->
                            <p>The ToF sensor has two modes: (.setDistanceModeMedium(); //3m has been removed)
                                <li>.setDistanceModeShort(); //1.3m</li>
                                <li>.setDistanceModeLong(); //4m</li>
                            </p>
                            <p>Information from the datasheet shows 
                                that the short mode can only reach up to 1.3m and is the most resistant to ambient 
                                light. The long mode can reach up to 4m but is very sensitive to ambient light, which 
                                decreases the distance to 0.73m. The timing budget range for the short mode is 20ms - 
                                1000ms. The timing range for the long mode is 33ms - 1000ms. Short mode has greater 
                                accuracy and less sensor noise compared to the long mode. While it would be beneficial 
                                for a robot that needs to sense objects farther away to use the long mode, for this lab 
                                I am prioritizing accuracy and choose to test the short mode.

                                This code was modified to include the line

                            <p>Sensor Range:</p>
                            <p>In the datasheet it is stated that the short mode for the ToF sensor has a range up to 1.3m.
                                To test the range of the sensor I took an initial measurement at 100mm and continued to take 
                                measurements up to 1900mm. The graph below shows the actual distance of the ToF sensor from 
                                the wall vs the ToF sensor distance.
                                The plotted measured distance value is the mean value of the ten collected data 
                                points. From the graph below it can be seen that after 1.3m the measured values start to 
                                differ more from the actual values compared to measured values less than 1.3m. 
                            </p>

                                ToF sensor was from the wall. When the ToF sensor is less than 1.3m from the wall, the difference 
                                is between 18mm and 40mm. After 1.3m the difference in the measured vs actual distance increases.

                            <p>Two ToF Sensors were connected to the Artemis board and Arduino code needed to be

                            <h4 class="mb-0">Active and Passive Infrared Sensors</h4>
                            <p>The two main types of infrared sensors are active and passive infrared sensors. Passive 
                                infrared sensors sense nearby emitted infrared light, using a difference in signals 
                                between two pyroelectric sensors. These sensors are often used for security 
                                purposes to detect if there is a heat energy change in the environment, but cannot 
                                determine the distance to an object.
                                Active infrared sensors use an emitter and receiver to determine the distance
                                to an object.  
                                If there is an obstruction, the active infrared sensor knows that there is an object 
                                in between the emitter and receiver. Active infrared sensors are used in industry 
                                conveyor belts, as well as in garage door safety mechanisms.

                                Different types of infrared sensors include proximity sensors, ToF sensors, and triangulation sensors.

                            <p>Four colors and three textures were tested at a distance of 500mm. Colors include pink, 
                                blue, yellow, and red. Textures include a hand towel, rug, and folder. The control 
                                surface was the dark grey wall that I used throughout the lab for distance readings.
                                The change in color or texture did not affect the ToF sensor's distance output that 
                                remained around 478mm.

                        <p>The example code found under 
                            SparkFun 9DOF IMU Breakout - ICM 20948 - Arduino Library->Arduino->Example1_Basics 
                            was run to test if the IMU was working correctly. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Upon opening the Example1_Basics code, the AD0_VAL default was set to one. When the ADR 
                            jumper is closed the value should be set to zero. AD0_VAL corresponds to the last bit 
                            of the I2C address. My ADR jumer on the IMU was closed. For this reason, I needed to 
                            change the AD0_VAL to zero to return the accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and 
                            temperature data.
                        </p>
                        <p>While viewing the output data 
                            in the serial monitor, I moved the IMU to change the accelerometer and gyroscope data. I 
                            looked at the notated axis that was printed on the IMU and moved the IMU along the X, 
                            Y, and Z axis. I noticed that the respective X, Y, and Z serial monitor outputs for the 
                            accelerometer increased

                            and yaw also changed when I rotated the IMU around the X, Y, and Z axis.

                            Note: The data for the graphs was collected by holding the IMU against the table using my hand. 
                            This may have resulted in some error due to the surface level or any small hand movements. In the
                            future the IMU should be calibrated when it is secured to the robot to achieve the most accurate 
                            pitch and roll data.

                            collected as I moved the IMU. The sinusoid and the FFT graphs can be found below. There is a large 
                            spike closer to 0Hz and less noise as the frequency increases. 
                            Note: I modified the code from Stephan Wagner's Ed Discussion post to plot the FFT graphs.

                        <p>From observing the above graphs, I choose a cutoff frequency of 25Hz to use for a low pass filter. 
                            Using the determined cutoff frequency, I calculated the alpha used in the low pass filter. The 
                            equations from lecture are below:

                        <p>The low pass filter was implemented in Arduino. The code to find pitch and roll for the accelerometer

                        <p>The data is stored in arrays on the Artemis board before being sent to Jupyter Notebook. There are 7 arrays including 
                            time (1); accelerometer: x (2), y (3), z (4); gyroscope: x (5), y (6), z (7). I choose to use separate arrays because
                            in the future I can decide what data I want to send to Jupyter Notebook. The data type used to store the data is a float.
                            I choose to use a float as it is less bytes then a double, allowing for more data to be stored on the memory of the 
                            Artemis. A float is 4 bytes, resulting in one packet of data information for the 7 arrays to be 28 bytes. The Artemis has 
                            384kB of RAM. Sampling at 0.04s (25Hz) will result in data being collected for 548 seconds.

                        <p>The robot is moved using the controller. The robot can move very quickly, but it is hard to 
                            control the speed. If the robot changes directions too quickly there is a chance that it 
                            might flip over. It is also hard to slow down the robot to a stop. When slowing down the 
                            robot, the reverse needs to be applied. This is easy to over compensate and the robot might 
                            end up traveling in reverse rather than coming to a stop.

                                and I added if statements (lines 113-122 below). The note A4 is 440Hz 
                                <a href="https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/eecs20/week8/scale.html#:~:text=The%20frequencies%20440Hz%20and%20880Hz,12%20notes%20in%20every%20octave.">(UC Berkeley Reference)</a>. 
                                The first if statement determines if the frequency is between 430Hz and 450Hz to account 
                                for any slight error in sound quality. If the frequency is within range an “A4” statement 
                                will be displayed in the Serial Monitor and the LED on the Artemis board will turn on. 
                                The second if statement determines if the frequency is lower than 430Hz or greater than 
                                450Hz. If the frequency is lower than 430Hz or greater than 450Hz a “Not A4” statement 
                                will be displayed in the Serial Monitor and the LED on the Artemis board will turn off.

<!-- Lab 1 Part 1 Discussion --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
                    <h2 class="mb-2.5">Discussion: Part 1</h2>
                    <p>I tested the connection between the Artemis board and the computer. Tasks performed included 
                        turning on and off an Artemis board LED, printing serial monitor outputs, viewing temperature 
                        data in the serial monitor, testing the microphone, and creating a musical tuner. 
                    </p>
<!-- Lab 1 Part 2 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
                    <h2 class="mb-5">Part 2</h2>
                    <p>Tested the Bluetooth communication between the computer and the Artemis board. Python in a 
                        Jupyter Notebook was used for the computer and Arduino IDE was used for the Artemis board.
                    </p>
<!-- Lab 1 Part 2 Prelab: Setup ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
                    <h2 class="mb-2.5">Prelab: Setup</h2>
                    <p>During the setup for the lab I already had installed Python 3. I needed to install pip by 
                        running the line "python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv" in the Command Line Interface 
                        (CLI). I created a folder called “MAE 5190 Lab” where I put all of the Jupyter Notebook files. 
                        I then created a virtual environment by typing "python3 -m venv FastRobots_ble" in the CLI. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The virtual environment was activated by typing "source FastRobots_ble/bin/activate" and then 
                        deactivated by typing "deactivate". 
                    </p>
                    <p>The python packages were installed by entering "pip install numpy pyyaml colorama nest_asyncio 
                        bleak jupyterlab" into the CLI.
                    </p>
                    <p>CLI entered commands:
                    </p>

                    <p>I also needed to install matplotlib to use for the 5000 level tasks. I asked a TA for help with 
                        the installation. Below is a picture of the command entered into the CLI.
                    </p>
                    <img width="auto" height="30" src="assets/img/matplotlib.png"></img>
                    <p>To import modules into the Jupyter Notebook the following lines of code were run.

                    <p>After uploading the provided ble_ardunio.ino file to the Artemis board the MAC address was 
                        printed in the serial monitor. The MAC address is c0:83:34:6a:b2:3c The image below shows 
                        the Arduino serial monitor with the printed MAC address.

<!-- Lab 1 Part 2 Prelab: Codebase --------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
                    <h2 class="mb-2.5">Prelab: Codebase</h2>
                    <p>I installed the provided codebase into the project directory and copied the provided 
                        “ble_python” directory into the project directory. Then the Jupyter Notebook was opened by 
                        entering “jupyter lab” into the CLI (shown below).
                    </p>
                    <img width="auto" height="20" src="assets/img/jupyterlab.png"></img>
                    <p>To set up Bluetooth communication, the MAC address needed to be changed in the Jupyter 
                        Notebook connection.yaml file to match the advertised MAC address from the Artemis board. 
                        Then unique UUID addresses needed to be used in the connection.yaml file and Arduino IDE 
                        because some devices in the lab may have the same MAC address. Using UUIDs ensures that 
                        the computer is receiving data from the correct Artemis board. The UUIDs were generated in 
                        the Jupyter Notebook demo.ipynb file and then entered into the connection.yaml and 
                        ble_arduino.ino files. Below is a picture of the lines of code used in the demo.ipynb file 
                        to generate the UUIDs.

                    <p>Several command types needed to be defined to complete the tasks outlined in the next section. 
                        Added commands include ECHO, GET_TIME_MILLIS, GET_TIME_MILLIS_LOOP, SEND_TIME_DATA, 
                        and GET_TEMP_READINGS.

                            <p>The method used in Task 4 involved sending the current time from the Artemis board to 
                                the computer. Each time was sent as an individual piece of data. The method used in 
                                Task 5 involved creating an array of times that was stored on the memory of the 
                                Artemis board and then sent to the computer to display the collected data. 
                            </p>
                            <p>The data transfer rate of the array method used in Task 5 (549600 bytes/second) is 
                                faster than the data transfer rate when sending individual pieces of data in Task 4 
                                (1348.018 bytes/second).
                            </p>
                            <p>An advantage of sending data individually as in Task 4 is that less memory on the 
                                Artemis board is being used, but the disadvantage is a slower data transfer rate. 
                                An advantage of sending data as an array as in Task 5 is that there is a faster data 
                                transfer rate, but a disadvantage is that more memory is being used on the Artemis 
                                to store the array.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Artemis board has a maximum storage of 384 kB of RAM. If 16 bit values at 150 Hz 
                                were sampled every 5 seconds, 256 values would be stored before running out of memory 
                                on the Artemis board. The calculations can be found below.

                            <p>I sent a message from the computer and received a reply from the Artemis board. The data 
                                rate for 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, and 120 bytes was tested. The 
                                data rate for 5 bytes is 132.722 bytes/s and the data rate for 120 bytes is 2003.210 
                                bytes/s. The plotted graph shows that as the number of bytes sent to the Artemis board 
                                increases, the data rate increases. Below are pictures of the Jupyter Notebook code, the 
                                graph, and the printed statements.

                            <p>I tested the reliability of sending data at a higher rate from the robot to the 
                                computer. To determine the reliability of the data I ran the GET_TEMP_READINGS 
                                command and compared the outputs printed in the Jupyter Notebook and the Arduino 
                                IDE Serial Monitor.

                            <p>After looking at the outputs, the time and temperature readings on the computer are 
                                the same as the Artemis board and no data is missed. To confirm I copied and pasted 
                                the data from each window into Matlab variables titled time1 and temp1 for the 
                                Jupyter Notebook data, and time2 and temp2 for the Artemis data. I wrote a script to 
                                compare the corresponding time and temperature data and record how many data points 
                                are the same and how many are different. If there is a data point in the Jupyter 
                                Notebook that does not correspond to the Artemis board, or vice versa, an error 
                                message is displayed. The output variables in the workspace show that all data points 
                                are the same. The reliability is 100%.

                    <p>I learned how to use Bluetooth communication and UUIDs, between the Artemis board and 
                        computer. I did not experience any significant problems connecting to Bluetooth.
