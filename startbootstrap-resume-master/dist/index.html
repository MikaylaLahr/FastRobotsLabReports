                        Arduino IDE was installed and a number of tasks were completed to show the functionality of 
                        the Artemis board.

                                were followed to ensure proper connection between the Artemis board and the computer. 
                                The SparkFun Apollo3 Boards package was installed using the Boards Manager in Arduino 
                                IDE. This board package was used to run the tasks for Part 1 of Lab 1. Below is a 
                                picture confirming that the SparkFun Apollo Board Manager was installed.

                            <p>The first task involved a blinking LED on the Artemis board. A prewritten example code 
                                was found under File->Examples->01.Basics->Blink. In the example code, a loop was 
                                implemented and used the function digitalWrite() to turn on the LED for one second 
                                and then turn off the LED for one second. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Below is a video showing the LED blinking on the Artemis board.

                            <p>The 5000 level task was to program the Artemis board to turn on the LED when the musical 
                                note A is played on a speaker. When the note A4 is not being played the LED is turned 
                                off. Below is the Arduino sketch that was used for this example. When writing the sketch 
                                I started with the Example01_MicrophoneOutput sketch from the previous task. I added if 
                                statements after the loudest frequency is printed. A musical note A4 is 440Hz 
                                <a href="https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/eecs20/week8/scale.html#:~:text=The%20frequencies%20440Hz%20and%20880Hz,12%20notes%20in%20every%20octave.">(UC Berkeley Reference)</a>. 
                                The first if statement determines if the frequency is between 430Hz and 450Hz to account 
                                for any slight error in sound quality. If the frequency is within range an “A4” statement 
                                will be displayed in the Serial Monitor and the LED on the Artemis board will turn on. 
                                The second if statement determines if the frequency is lower than 430Hz or greater than 
                                450Hz. If the frequency is lower than 430Hz or greater than 450Hz a “Not A4” statement 
                                will be displayed in the Serial Monitor and the LED on the Artemis board will turn off.
                            </p>
                            <p>Below is an image of the altered lines in the sketch. I added the if statements in lines 
                                113 to 122.

                            <p>I added to the LED and Musical A4 task by creating a musical tuner. The LED on the Artemis 
                                turns on when the musical note A4 is played and is off when A4 is not played. There are 
                                eleven total if statements that determine the note being played:

                            <p>The first task of Part 2 was to send an ECHO command of a string value to the Artemis 
                                board and receive an augmented string on the host computer. This task tested the 
                                communication between the Artemis board and the computer. In order to successfully 
                                run this command the line ECHO = 3 needed to be added to the Jupyter Notebook file 
                                cmd_types.py and the statement ECHO needed to be added to the Arduino IDE 
                                ble_arduino.ino file in the section enum CommandTypes. 
                            </p>

                                the line GET_TIME_MILLIS = 6 needed to be added to the Jupyter Notebook file

                            <p>A notification handler was created in the Python Jupyter Notebook to receive a 
                                string value from the Artemis board. The GET_TIME_MILLIS command was used to 
                                get the time after starting the notification handler.
