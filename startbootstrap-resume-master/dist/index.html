                        <p>The SparkFun 9DOF IMU Breakout - ICM 20948 - Arduino Library was installed as seen below.
                        </p>
                        <img width="500" height="auto" src="Lab2/IMULibrary.png"></img>
                        <p>The setup for this lab is shown in the image below. The IMU is connected to the Artemis 
                            board using the QWIIC connector.
                        </p>
                        <img width="550" height="auto" src="Lab2/Lab2Setup.jpeg"></img>
                        <p>The example code found under 
                            SparkFun 9DOF IMU Breakout - ICM 20948 - Arduino Library->Arduino->Example1_Basics 
                            was run to test if the IMU was working correctly. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Upon opening the Example1_Basics code, the AD0_VAL default was set to one. When the ADR 
                            jumper is closed the value should be set to zero. AD0_VAL corresponds to the last bit 
                            of the I2C address. My ADR jumer on the IMU was closed. For this reason, I needed to 
                            change the AD0_VAL to zero to return the accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and 
                            temperature data.
                        </p>
                        <p>The below video and picture show the code properly running. While viewing the output data 
                            in the serial monitor, I moved the IMU to change the accelerometer and gyroscope data. I 
                            looked at the notated axis that was printed on the IMU and moved the IMU along the X, 
                            Y, and Z axis. I noticed that the respective X, Y, and Z serial monitor outputs changed 
                            when I moved the IMU. Moving the accelerometer in the X direction resulted in the X outputs 
                            increasing, moving along the Y direction resulted in the Y outputs increasing, and moving 
                            along the Z direction resulted in the Z outputs increasing. The gyroscope data also changed 
                            when I rotated the IMU. As roll was moved rightwards the X component of the gyroscope 
                            increased, as the pitch moved downwards the Y component increased, and as yaw was rotated 
                            clockwise the Z component increased.

                        <p>In the Example1_Basics code, I added a slow blink at the beginning of void setup() to 
                            turn the Artemis LED on and off three times to indicate that the code has been uploaded.
                            The added lines can be found below.

                        <p>The following equations for pitch (theta) and roll (phi) were found in the FastRobots-4-IMU 
                            Lecture Presentation.

                        <p>These equations were used to compute pitch and roll for the accelerometer. I implemented the 
                            calculations in the Example1_Basics sketch (lines 247 - 255 below) that was used in the 
                            previous task to receive continuous data from the Artemis board and plot the results.

                        <p>The below graphs show Pitch (data 0, green) and Roll (data 1, purple) at 0 degrees. The x-axis 
                            is time (sec) and the y-axis is degrees.

                        <p>The below graphs show Pitch (data 0, green) at -90 and 90 degrees and the corresponding Roll 
                            (data 1, purple) outputs. The x-axis is time (sec) and the y-axis is degrees. From the graphs 
                            it can be seen that when pitch is at -90 degrees there is noise in the roll outputs.

                            <p>The Artemis board was programmed to turn on the LED when the musical note A4 is played 
                                on a speaker (code below). I started with the Example01_MicrophoneOutput sketch, 
                                and I added if statements (lines 113-122 below). The note A4 is 440Hz 
                                <a href="https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/eecs20/week8/scale.html#:~:text=The%20frequencies%20440Hz%20and%20880Hz,12%20notes%20in%20every%20octave.">(UC Berkeley Reference)</a>. 
                                The first if statement determines if the frequency is between 430Hz and 450Hz to account 
                                for any slight error in sound quality. If the frequency is within range an “A4” statement 
                                will be displayed in the Serial Monitor and the LED on the Artemis board will turn on. 
                                The second if statement determines if the frequency is lower than 430Hz or greater than 
                                450Hz. If the frequency is lower than 430Hz or greater than 450Hz a “Not A4” statement 
                                will be displayed in the Serial Monitor and the LED on the Artemis board will turn off.

<!-- Lab 1 Part 2 Prelab: Setup ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
                    <h2 class="mb-2.5">Prelab: Setup</h2>
                    <p>During the setup for the lab I already had installed Python 3. I needed to install pip by 
                        running the line "python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv" in the Command Line Interface 
                        (CLI). I created a folder called “MAE 5190 Lab” where I put all of the Jupyter Notebook files. 
                        I then created a virtual environment by typing "python3 -m venv FastRobots_ble" in the CLI. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The virtual environment was activated by typing "source FastRobots_ble/bin/activate" and then 
                        deactivated by typing "deactivate". 
                    </p>
                    <p>The python packages were installed by entering "pip install numpy pyyaml colorama nest_asyncio 
                        bleak jupyterlab" into the CLI.
                    </p>
                    <p>CLI entered commands:

                    <p>I also needed to install matplotlib to use for the 5000 level tasks. I asked a TA for help with 
                        the installation. Below is a picture of the command entered into the CLI.

                    <p>After uploading the provided ble_ardunio.ino file to the Artemis board the MAC address was 
                        printed in the serial monitor. The MAC address is c0:83:34:6a:b2:3c The image below shows 
                        the Arduino serial monitor with the printed MAC address.

<!-- Lab 1 Part 2 Prelab: Codebase --------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
                    <h2 class="mb-2.5">Prelab: Codebase</h2>
                    <p>I installed the provided codebase into the project directory and copied the provided 
                        “ble_python” directory into the project directory. Then the Jupyter Notebook was opened by 
                        entering “jupyter lab” into the CLI (shown below).
                    </p>
                    <img width="auto" height="20" src="assets/img/jupyterlab.png"></img>
                    <p>To set up Bluetooth communication, the MAC address needed to be changed in the Jupyter 
                        Notebook connection.yaml file to match the advertised MAC address from the Artemis board. 
                        Then unique UUID addresses needed to be used in the connection.yaml file and Arduino IDE 
                        because some devices in the lab may have the same MAC address. Using UUIDs ensures that 
                        the computer is receiving data from the correct Artemis board. The UUIDs were generated in 
                        the Jupyter Notebook demo.ipynb file and then entered into the connection.yaml and

                            <p>The method used in Task 4 involved sending the current time from the Artemis board to 
                                the computer. Each time was sent as an individual piece of data. The method used in 
                                Task 5 involved creating an array of times that was stored on the memory of the 
                                Artemis board and then sent to the computer to display the collected data. 
                            </p>
                            <p>The data transfer rate of the array method used in Task 5 (549600 bytes/second) is 
                                faster than the data transfer rate when sending individual pieces of data in Task 4 
                                (1348.018 bytes/second).
                            </p>
                            <p>An advantage of sending data individually as in Task 4 is that less memory on the 
                                Artemis board is being used, but the disadvantage is a slower data transfer rate. 
                                An advantage of sending data as an array as in Task 5 is that there is a faster data 
                                transfer rate, but a disadvantage is that more memory is being used on the Artemis 
                                to store the array.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Artemis board has a maximum storage of 384 kB of RAM. If 16 bit values at 150 Hz 
                                were sampled every 5 seconds, 256 values would be stored before running out of memory 
                                on the Artemis board. The calculations can be found below.

                            <p>I tested the reliability of sending data at a higher rate from the robot to the 
                                computer. To determine the reliability of the data I ran the GET_TEMP_READINGS 
                                command and compared the outputs printed in the Jupyter Notebook and the Arduino 
                                IDE Serial Monitor. 
                            </p>

                            <p>Outputs in the Jupyter Notebook (left) and the Arduino Serial Monitor (right):

                            <img width="650" height="auto" src="assets/img/ReliabilityArduinoAndPython.png"></img>
                            <p>After looking at the outputs, the time and temperature readings on the computer are 
                                the same as the Artemis board and no data is missed. To confirm I copied and pasted 
                                the data from each window into Matlab variables titled time1 and temp1 for the 
                                Jupyter Notebook data, and time2 and temp2 for the Artemis data. I wrote a script to 
                                compare the corresponding time and temperature data and record how many data points 
                                are the same and how many are different. If there is a data point in the Jupyter 
                                Notebook that does not correspond to the Artemis board, or vice versa, an error 
                                message is displayed. The output variables in the workspace show that all data points 
                                are the same. The reliability is 100%.

                    <p>I learned how to use Bluetooth communication and UUIDs, between the Artemis board and 
                        computer. I did not experience any significant problems connecting to Bluetooth.
