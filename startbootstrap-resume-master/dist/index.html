                                were followed to ensure proper connection between the Artemis board and the computer. 
                                The SparkFun Apollo3 Boards package was installed using the Boards Manager in Arduino 
                                IDE. This board package was used to run the tasks for Part 1 of Lab 1. Below is a 
                                picture confirming that the SparkFun Apollo Board Manager was installed.

                            <p>The first task involved a blinking LED on the Artemis board. A prewritten example code 
                                was found under File->Examples->01.Basics->Blink. In the example code, a loop was 
                                implemented and used the function digitalWrite() to turn on the LED for one second 
                                and then turn off the LED for one second. 
                            </p>

                            <p>The 5000 level task was to program the Artemis board to turn on the LED when the musical 
                                note A is played on a speaker. When the note A4 is not being played the LED is turned 
                                off. Below is the Arduino sketch that was used for this example. When writing the sketch 
                                I started with the Example01_MicrophoneOutput sketch from the previous task. I added if 
                                statements after the loudest frequency is printed. A musical note A4 is 440Hz 
                                <a href="https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/eecs20/week8/scale.html#:~:text=The%20frequencies%20440Hz%20and%20880Hz,12%20notes%20in%20every%20octave.">(UC Berkeley Reference)</a>. 
                                The first if statement determines if the frequency is between 430Hz and 450Hz to account 
                                for any slight error in sound quality. If the frequency is within range an “A4” statement 
                                will be displayed in the Serial Monitor and the LED on the Artemis board will turn on. 
                                The second if statement determines if the frequency is lower than 430Hz or greater than 
                                450Hz. If the frequency is lower than 430Hz or greater than 450Hz a “Not A4” statement 
                                will be displayed in the Serial Monitor and the LED on the Artemis board will turn off.
                            </p>
                            <p>Below is an image of the altered lines in the sketch. I added the if statements in lines 
                                113 to 122.

                            <p>I added to the LED and Musical A4 task by creating a musical tuner. The LED on the Artemis 
                                turns on when the musical note A4 is played and is off when A4 is not played. There are 
                                eleven total if statements that determine the note being played:

<!-- Lab 1 Part 1 Discussion --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
                    <h2 class="mb-2.5">Discussion: Part 1</h2>
                    <p>Part 1 of the lab involved testing the connection between the Artemis board and the computer. 
                        Various tasks were performed including turning on and off an LED on the Artemis board, 
                        printing outputs in the serial monitor, viewing temperature data in the serial monitor, 
                        testing the microphone, and creating a musical tuner using the LED and microphone functions 
                        of the Artemis board. 
                    </p>
<!-- Lab 1 Part 2 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
                    <h2 class="mb-5">Part 2</h2>
                    <p>The objective of Part 2 of the lab was to ensure that Bluetooth communication between the 
                        computer and the Artemis board was working correctly. Python in a Jupyter Notebook was used 
                        for the computer and Arduino IDE was used for the Artemis board.
                    </p>
<!-- Lab 1 Part 2 Prelab: Setup ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
                    <h2 class="mb-2.5">Prelab: Setup</h2>
                    <p>During the setup for the lab I already had installed Python 3. I needed to install pip by 
                        running the line "python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv" in the Command Line Interface 
                        (CLI). I created a folder called “MAE 5190 Lab” where I put all of the Jupyter Notebook files. 
                        I then created a virtual environment by typing "python3 -m venv FastRobots_ble" in the CLI. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The virtual environment was activated by typing "source FastRobots_ble/bin/activate" and then 
                        deactivated by typing "deactivate". 
                    </p>
                    <p>The python packages were installed by entering "pip install numpy pyyaml colorama nest_asyncio 
                        bleak jupyterlab" into the CLI.
                    </p>
                    <p>The below pictures show the commands entered into the CLI.
                    </p>

                    <p>In addition to the above inatallations I also needed to intall matplotlib to use for the 5000
                        level tasks. I asked a TA for help for the installation. Below is a picture of the command 
                        entered into the CLI.
                    </p>

                    <p>To import modules into the Jupyter Notebook the following lines of code were run.

                    <p>After uploading the provided ble_ardunio.ino file to the Artemis board the MAC address was 
                        printed in the serial monitor. The MAC address is c0:83:34:6a:b2:3c The image below shows 
                        the Arduino serial monitor with the printed MAC address.

<!-- Lab 1 Part 2 Prelab: Codebase --------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
                    <h2 class="mb-2.5">Prelab: Codebase</h2>
                    <p>The next steps of the prelab involved installing the provided codebase into the project 
                        directory and copying the provided “ble_python” directory from the lab instructions into the 
                        project directory. After successfully uploading to the directory the Jupyter Notebook was 
                        opened by entering “jupyter lab” into the CLI. The image below shows the entered command in 
                        the CLI.
                    </p>
                    <img width="auto" height="50" src="assets/img/jupyterlab.png"></img>
                    <p>To set up bluetooth communication, the MAC address needed to be changed in the Jupyter 
                        Notebook connection.yaml file to match the advertised MAC address from the Artemis board. 
                        Then unique UUID addresses needed to be used in the connection.yaml file and Arduino IDE 
                        because some devices in the lab may have the same MAC address. Using UUIDs ensures that 
                        the computer is receiving data from the correct Artemis board. The UUIDs were generated in 
                        the Jupyter Notebook demo.ipynb file and then entered into the connection.yaml and 
                        ble_arduino.ino files. Below is a picture of the lines of code used in the demo.ipynb file 
                        to generate the UUIDs.

                    <p>To connect to the Artemis the following lines are run in the Jupyter Notebook.</p>
                    <img width="400" height="auto" src="assets/img/ConnectionPython.png"></img>
                    <p>In addition to establishing the bluetooth connection, several command types needed to be 
                        defined. These command types were used to complete the tasks outlined in the next section. 
                    </p>

                            <p>In this task, a second array was added to store temperature readings from the Artemis 
                                board. The temperature array is the same size as the time array. The time and 
                                temperature readings were taken at the same time. The data is sent as an array to 
                                the computer using Jupyter Notebook. In order to successfully run this command the 
                                line GET_TEMP_READINGS = 9 needed to be added to the Jupyter Notebook file cmd_types.py 
                                and the statement GET_TEMP_READINGS needed to be added to the Arduino IDE ble_arduino.ino 
                                file in the section enum CommandTypes.

                            <p>The method used in Task 4 involved sending the current time from the Artemis board to 
                                the computer. Each time was sent as an individual piece of data. The method used in 
                                Task 5 involved creating an array of times that was stored on the memory of the 
                                Artemis board and then sent to the computer to display the collected data. 
                            </p>
                            <p>The data transfer rate of the array method used in Task 5 (549600 bytes/second) is 
                                faster than the data transfer rate when sending individual pieces of data in Task 4 
                                (1348.018 bytes/second).
                            </p>
                            <p>An advantage of sending data individually as in Task 4 is that less memory on the 
                                Artemis board is being used, but the disadvantage is a slower data transfer rate. 
                                An advantage of sending data as an array as in Task 5 is that there is a faster data 
                                transfer rate, but a disadvantage is that more memory is being used on the Artemis 
                                to store the array.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Artemis board has a maximum storage of 384 kB of RAM. If 16 bit values at 150 Hz 
                                were sampled every 5 seconds, 256 values would be stored before running out of memory 
                                on the Artemis board. The calculations can be found below.
